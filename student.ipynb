    "This project deals with a company that is seeking to expand to new industries to expand its portfolio by  purchasing and operating airplanes for commercial and private enterprises. Through a comprehensive analysis of aviation accident data from 1962 to 2023, we will conduct an exploratory data analysis to provide insights on the frequency and distribution of accidents over time and across different airports. Ultimately, our goal is to provide actionable insights that will guide the company's entry into the aircraft industry, and set it up for long-term success and profitability."
